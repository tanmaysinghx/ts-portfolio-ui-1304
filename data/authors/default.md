As a passionate and versatile developer, I specialize in frontend technologies like Angular, React, and Next.js, creating seamless and intuitive user experiences. My journey in the tech world doesn't stop there; I'm actively working with and learning backend technologies such as Node.js and Spring Boot to build robust and scalable applications. Additionally, I am enhancing my skills in cloud computing with AWS and mastering DevOps practices using Docker and Jenkins for efficient CI/CD pipelines. My enthusiasm for technology extends to iOS development, where I am continually expanding my knowledge to craft innovative mobile solutions. With a commitment to excellence and a drive for continuous learning, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality software that meets the needs of users and businesses alike.
